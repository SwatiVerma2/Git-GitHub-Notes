## ADD

- The git add command is used to add changes from the working directory (your local files) to the staging area. 
- This is the first step in the process of committing changes. 
- You must add the changes to the staging area before committing them to the repository.

  `git add <file>` - Add a specific file to the staging area
  
  `git add .` - Add all modified and untracked files to the staging area
  
  `git add <directory>` - Add all changes in a specific directory

## Commit

- The git commit command is used to capture a snapshot of the staged changes and save them to the local repository. 
- It is the second step after git add, and it creates a new commit containing the staged changes. 
- Commits represent snapshots of your project at specific points in time.

  `git commit -m "some message"` - Creates a commit with a message describing the changes.
