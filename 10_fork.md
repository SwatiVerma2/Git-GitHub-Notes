# Fork

- Forking is a way to create a personal copy of someone else's repository under your own account. 
- This copy allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 
- After making changes in your fork, you can propose these changes to be merged back into the original repository through a pull request. 
- Forking is commonly used in open-source projects where contributors want to work on features or fixes independently before merging them into the main project.

**Key Concepts:**

- Forking: Creating a copy of a repository under your GitHub account. This copy is completely independent of the original repository, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.

- Pull Request: After making changes to your forked repository, you can propose those changes to the original repository by creating a pull request. This allows the maintainers of the original repository to review and merge your changes.

## How to Fork a Repository on GitHub:

- On the top right of the repository page, click the "Fork" button. This creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
